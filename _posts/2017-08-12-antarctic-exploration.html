    Watch our gravity meter AT1A-5 in action above the Antarctic Ice Shelf - AT1A-5 was manufactured for Columbia University's
    Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) group, where they have used the sensor to perform surveys of the Ross Ice Shelf.

    See the survey in virtual-reality in the video below by the New York Times 'A Shifting Continent':
