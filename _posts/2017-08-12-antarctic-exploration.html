    See our airborne gravity meter <a href="/products/at1a/#content">AT1A-5</a> as it flies above the Antarctic Ross Ice
    Shelf aboard one of the New York Air National Guard's LC-130 aircraft.

<p>
    AT1A-5 was manufactured for Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) Polar Geophysics group,
    where they have used the sensor to perform aerial gravity surveying of the Ross Ice Shelf as part of the Rosetta project.
