#### DgS Provides Airborne Gravity Meter for Columbia LDEO Antarctic Survey ####

Watch our gravity meter AT1A-5 in action above the Antarctic Ice Shelf - AT1A-5 was produced for Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) group, where they have used the sensor to perform surveys of the Ross Ice Shelf.
