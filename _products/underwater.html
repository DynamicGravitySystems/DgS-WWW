        Gravity is a powerful tool to profile underground structures. Surface ship gravity is an efficient way to collect
        gravity over a relatively large marine region with medium resolution, due to the distance from the sea floor.
        A sea-floor gravity meter can observe gravity with high resolution, but are limited to small areas and quiet sites.

        The AT1-AUV-M can allow operators to match the performance of the sea bottom meters, but over a much larger area,
        through integration with your autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), allowing high-resolution data collection over
        an area dependent only on your AUV platform.

        Typically, gravity drifts less than 2 mGals/month and 0.5 mGals/month after aging. This sensor also  has excellent
        clamp / un-clamp repeatability, almost comparable with a Land Meter, which allows the meter to be used as a sea
        bottom surveying meter with  repeatability  better than 0.030 mGals.
        The AT-AUV has been designed as a Dynamic Gravity Sensor with with a world-wide gravity range of 20,000 mGals
        making the sensor ideal for dynamic gravity reading.
        For this application the user needs to provide a suitable gyroscopic stabilizing platform and accurate positioning capability.
        A typical repeatability of the dynamic readings is sigma < 0.060 mGal.
