                DgS can offer repair and upgrade services on Micro-g Lacoste MgL AirSeaII systems, both air-damped and magnetically damped.
            </li>
            <li>We also manufacture and sell new control modules for MgL AirSeaII systems which can be field-swapped in
                place of the original systems. These modules have vastly updated and more robust computer data acquisition systems, and an updated software interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can also perform diagnostics on your systems at your location - worldwide; or at our facility.
