        Dynamic Gravity Systems specializes in the manufacture, repair, and servicing of marine and airborne gravity
        meters.
        We make advanced technology gravity meters using a full feedback, zero-length spring sensor, which requires no
        spring
        tension motor and is more responsive and accurate across the full worldwide range and the dynamic motions
        experienced
        in aircraft and ships.
    </p>
    <p class="flow-text thin">
        We also repair air damped gravity meters manufactured by Lacoste and Romberg (SeaSys and AirSeaII), ZLS
        (Ultrasys) and
        Micro-g Lacoste (AirSeaII) as well as the magnetically damped marine meter and Turnkey Airborne Gravity System
        (TAGS)
        made by Micro-g Lacoste.
