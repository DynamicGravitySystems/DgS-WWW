Dynamic Gravity Systems specializes in the manufacture, repair, and servicing of marine and airborne gravity meters. 
We make advanced technology gravity meters using a full feedback, zero-length spring sensor, which requires no spring 
tension motor and is more responsive and accurate across the full worldwide range and the dynamic motions experienced 
in aircraft and ships.

We also repair air damped gravity meters manufactured by Lacoste and Romberg (Seasys and AirSeaII), ZLS (Ultrasys) and
 Micro-g Lacoste (AirSeaII) as well as the magnetically damped marine meter and Turnkey Airborne Gravity System (TAGS) 
 made by Micro-g Lacoste.
